# Clochette

This is a simple sinatra app to play around with sinatra, haml, and the
NY Times API.

Just register at NY Times dev branch to get an api key, put it in the
config.yml file and startup the app.

Even if a lot of people didn't like it I quite liked the "redesign" of
the NY Times pushed by Andy Rutledge ( http://andyrutledge.com/news-redux.php).

So, before doing something closer to that design I had to play with the
NY Times API to know how to get the titles and stuff. Here is the
result.
